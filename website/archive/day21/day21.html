      <h2>February 9 – Day 21</h2>
<p>8:02 AM – Eon Musk expresses interest in shutting down Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. 1. Europe is free now besides stifling bureaucracy (I guess the Russian invasion doesn’t count), 2. Nobody listens to them anymore, and 3. It’s just radical leftists talking to themselves and wasting $1b every year.</p>
<p>9:00 AM – CBS polling indicates broad popular support for Trump’s policy stances and decisions, especially from Republicans. Notable marks against Trump include 52% of polltakers opposing large detention centers, only 13% of pollsters thinking that a US takeover of Gaza would be a good idea, 66% thinking he hasn’t done enough to lower prices, and most people opposing tariffs on US allies.</p>
<p>9:16 AM – A Trump interview with FOX News anchor Bret Baier says that DOGE’s next targets will be the Department of Education and the US Military. He also deflected when asked if he trusted Elon Musk, “Trust Elon? Oh, he's not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He's so into it." When asked if his wish for Canada to become a US state was a “real thing,” Trump replied “Yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>10:00 AM – Upcoming book "Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump's Return to Power,” by Jason Brodsky will also explore Trump’s attempts to protect himself from Iranian assassination. These include using decoy jets because of intelligence suggesting that Iranian operatives had access to SAMs on American soil.</p>
<p>10:13 AM – In response to federal judges blocking several of Trump’s actions, JD Vance commented that “Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.” Note: judges can block executive actions if they violate the law or overstep the bounds of their power, it’s called “checks and balances.”</p>
<p>10:26 AM – National Security Advisor Mike Waltz appeared on NBC News and was asked if Trump was serious about annexing Canada. He replied “I think the Canadian people, many of them, would love to join the United States.”</p>
<p>10:30 AM – Telegraph reporting that Elon Musk is planning to replace government workers with AIs. “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats.”</p>
<p>11:37 AM – Sen. Chris Murphy [D-CT] on ABC does not mince words. "I think this is the most serious constitutional crisis the country has faced, certainly since Watergate. The president is attempting to seize control of power, and for corrupt purposes … he's trying to crush his opposition … this is a red alert moment … our democracy is at risk.”</p>
<p>11:49 AM – Trump will allow Elon Musk to hire 45 more DOGE operatives to manage and audit the FBI, CIA, and Pentagon.</p>
<p>2:04 PM – Trump is considering a mid-air stunt while flying from Mar-a-lago to New Orleans for the Super Bowl to highlight the name change of the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. His team is still discussing the stunt.</p>
<p>2:07 PM – CFPB notifies their staff that their HQ in Washington, DC, will be closed the week of February 10.</p>
<p>2:20 PM – DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [R-SD] says on Twitter: “The FBI is so corrupt. We will work with any and every agency to stop leaks and prosecute these crooked deep state agents to the fullest extent of the law.”</p>
<p>2:47 PM – Chinese retaliatory tariffs enter into effect after being announced a week ago on February 4. A 15% tariff on American coal and LNG, and a 10% tariff on American oil, agricultural machinery, and large engine cars.</p>
<p>2:56 PM – The ICE tip line is being overwhelmed by callers reporting Elon Musk. The tip line was previously shut down for the exact same reason a few days into the administration.</p>
<p>3:15 PM – Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, currently being held at Guantanamo Bay, has agreed to accept a plea deal and lifetime gag order on CIA torture methods to avoid a death-penalty trial. He was the man that planned the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>3:33 PM – US Secret Service paid Michael Bay to produce a 1 minute long Super Bowl ad.</p>
<p>3:36 PM – Dozens of federal websites have shut down, including https://reproductiveaccess.gov, https://reprorights.gov, https://environmentaljustice.gov, https://childtaxcredit.gov, https://investinginamerica.gov, and https://buildbackbetter.gov.</p>
<p>4:21 PM – While flying over the Gulf of Mexico, Donald Trump signed a proclamation declaring February 9, 2025, to be the first “Gulf of America Day.” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum [R-ND] announces that the USGS and Department of the Interior officially recognize the Gulf of America as its real name.</p>
<p>4:32 PM – Trump claims that DOGE may have found evidence of fraud at the Treasury. He claims the US might have “less debt than we thought,” and that they may disregard some debt.</p>
<p>4:44 PM – While speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he will announce 25% tariffs on all imports of aluminum and steel tomorrow.</p>
<p>5:00 PM – Trump expresses disappointment at court rulings not favoring DOGE operations: “The day you’re not allowed to look for theft and fraud, etc., we don’t have much of a country. No judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of a decision. It’s a disgrace.”</p>
<p>6:00 PM – Luis Alberto Castillo, a Venezuelan migrant, was sent to Guantanamo Bay after not having set foot once in the US illegally. He entered the country at El Paso for an asylum hearing via CBP One on January 19. Castillo had an Air Jordan and Crown tattoo on his body.</p>
<p>6:09 PM – Donald Trump makes economic threats towards Canada. “They do almost all of their business with us. And if we say we want our cars to be made in Detroit, with the stroke of a pen, I can do that and other things that…could not allow Canada to be a viable country.”</p>
<p>9:27 PM – While watching the Super Bowl, Trump announces on Truth Social that he has instructed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to stop the production of new pennies. It costs more money than what a penny is worth to produce them.</p>
